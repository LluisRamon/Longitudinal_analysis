# Abstract

# Introduction

The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of different doses of Berenil in cattle infected with the trypanosomosis parasite. This disease, transmitted by the tsetse flies, causes an infection characterized by fever, loss of apetite and anaemia, which can lead to death depending on numerous factors such as the number of births or the innate resistance of the host.

A variable often measured to evaluate the severity of the disease is the packed cell volume, PCV.

Variables:
ID  Dose	PCV	Time	numbirths

These data set is the measurement of PCV on 5 cows.

* the repeated measurement factor is time (Time)
* there is one "treatment" factor, Dose, with values L, M and H (Low, Medium and High doses of Berenil, respectively)
* an additional covariate, numbirths, is also available. It indicates the number of biths that a cow had before the treatment administration.
* the response is PCV-packed cell volume
