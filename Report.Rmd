# Abstract

# Introduction

The aim is to study the efficacy of different doses of Berenil when applied to cattle in a herd shown to be infected with the parasite of trypanosomosis. The disease is transmitted by the tsetse flies and when animals are infected they often become anaemic and can die.
A variable often measured to evaluate the severity of the disease is the packed cell volume, PCV.

Variables:
ID  Dose	PCV	Time	numbirths

These data set is the measurement of PCV on 5 cows.

* the repeated measurement factor is time (Time)
* there is one "treatment" factor, Dose, with values L, M and H (Low, Medium and High doses of Berenil, respectively)
* an additional covariate, numbirths, is also available. It indicates the number of biths that a cow had before the treatment administration.
* the response is PCV-packed cell volume
